# Creative Coding with Three.js: Grids!

Follow the creative coding process as we block out a Joshua-Davis-style grid in Three.js, swap bold color palettes, and drop in GTAO for beautiful depth — let's see what surprises emerge. It’s iterative, playful, and full of unexpected successes that you can remix into your own.
